Deep Rock Galactic Items is a love letter to one of my favorite games of all time, Deep Rock Galactic. Big shoutout to Ghost Ship Games, they have done excellent work and DRG does not get the credit it deserves.

Ghost Ship Games owns Deep Rock Galactic as an IP. This mod is partially my own ideas, however it would be wrong to not support DRG. You can (and should!) buy the game here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/

This mod adds 4 weapons from the game with many upgrades for each, a unique pet, and Mission Control himself.

[c/D30B09:This mod is in very early access. Although I've added most (or all) of the content I want to add, there will be bugs, especially in multiplayer. It is HIGHLY recommended that you create a new player and world to experience this mod, and play singleplayer only.]
If you would like to help contribute to the mod to add items or fix bugs, feel free to do so. The mod is open source at https://https://github.com/scottysimply/deeprockitems.
